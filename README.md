    Kassel Hand Project Lookalike Printable Model README

    This file repository contains the files for the Lookalike model of the Kassel Hand. Its interior components appear and move like 
    the original artifact, but these components are fragile because of their construction. If you have questions about this repository's purpose or are unsure of how to start the 
    printing process, head back to this model's webpage and check out the section titled, "New to Printing?" Happy printing!

    1.) Print Settings

    a.) General Print Settings
        i.) We used an Anycubic Kobra 3 with the Anycubic Slicer.
       ii.) 2 Vertical, 4 Horizontal Shells with a minimum thickness of 0.6mm
      iii.) 15% infill density, grid pattern
       iv.) 0.16mm layer height
        v.) Organic supports with a 0.28mm Z contact distance and 2.5mm spacing
       vi.) Top and bottom interface layers should be 3 layers thick.
      vii.) Print the paddle (M-11) oriented where the flat of the paddle is normal 
            to the plate and the rod is prarllel. While this may seem like the 
            worst oritnetation to print, the goal is to have the layer lines run 
            along the rod and for the presence of unbroken layers circumnavigating 
            the entire rod and paddle. This is for maximum strength.
                1.) If you are using this as a display model, then you can print it 
                    with the thin rod on the plate with the paddled pointed up, 
                    like a letter "L" rotated backwards 90 degrees.
       ix.) Print both shells, flies that begin with "S##" vertically. That is, the 
            region where the fingers will eventually be installed should be pointed 
            upwards and the wrist end of the gauntlet should be on the plate.
        x.) Print the rest of the mechanism parts, those with file names starting 
            with "M##" with their flattest end on the plate. This includes all 
            fingers: M-07, M-08, M-09, and M-10.
       xi.) M-13 and M-14, the axles, can be printed horizontally. The rod rests 
            length-wise along the plate.
      xii.) M-15 is an exceptional to Part viii--for best results, we have found 
            printing with the loop parallel to the plate is best.
     xiii.) M-16 should be printed with the loop flat on the plate as you would 
            expect a ring to sit atop a table.

    2.) File Naming Convention--"L-##-[Name of Part]-#X"
        
    a.) The first character, "L," is a letter. This letter will be either "M" 
        for Mechanism or "S" for Shell.
            i.) Shell is printed out of gray and is a structural part.
           ii.) Mechanism is any movable part that is integral to the actuation.
    b.) The two-digit segment next to this letter identifies the part.
    c.) The "Name of Part" is the colloquial term for the part in question--
        it's easier to identify if you need a new ring finger than a 
        replacement "M-03."
    d.) "#X" is how many copies are needed.
